# JA2v1.13-7609-GameDir

- GameDir for JA2 v1.13 7609 (a.k.a. "stable 2014") (migrated from SVN on 12.11.2022)


**Technical Information**

- been migrated from svn to gitHub on 12.11.2022 (based on https://ja2svn.mooo.com/source/ja2_v1.13_data/branches/ja2_data_official_2014)

- latest commit before migration was on 27.10.2020, as you can see, that is past 2014 and is due to the fact that it has seen bugfixes since then


**Additional Information**

- an already fully assembled version of complete JA2v1.13 7609 [7609 SCI](http://www.mediafire.com/file/12jqupe1q2ksa3b/7609_SCI.7z/file)

- with the SCI there is no need to do any assemble anything yourself, it's ready to go, just copy contents of zip into original JA2 main folder and overwrite

- it's based on the latest commit before svn to gitHub migration (Oct 27, 2020) and contains all bugfixes up to this date

- of course the SCI also contains the exe, the standard 7609-exe 

- if you want the 7609+AI-exe instead check downloads provided by the author sevenfm (see links under his youtube-videos or at russian ja2 forum) 
  (closed development, won't be on gitHub unless the author himselves decides to do so)
